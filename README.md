# Kampung Keepers üå±

Welcome to Kampung Keepers, an innovative and gamified application designed to track and celebrate the progress of Ground Up Initiative's (GUI) volunteers. At the heart of our mission is the belief that every volunteer's contribution, no matter how small, plays a crucial role in fostering sustainable communities. Kampung Keepers provides a platform for volunteers to actively engage, share experiences, and be recognized for their dedication.

## Features üöÄ

### Volunteer Progress Tracker
Embark on a rewarding journey as you level up and collect badges! The progress tracker not only serves as a visual representation of your achievements but also encourages continuous participation. Whether you're a seasoned volunteer or just starting, there's always an opportunity to earn badges and reach new levels.

### Admin Dashboard
For administrators, the application comes with a dedicated Admin Dashboard. Admins can use this feature to track the overall progress of volunteers, monitor survey responses, and gain insights into the collective impact of the community. The Admin Dashboard serves as a powerful tool for managing and optimizing the volunteering experience.

### Volunteer Survey
Your insights matter! Participate in interactive surveys designed to gather valuable information that helps GUI analyze the depth of our collective impact. Your responses contribute to shaping future initiatives and enhancing the overall volunteer experience.

### Environment Adventures Forum
Share your environmental adventures with fellow volunteers in our dedicated forum. Whether it's growing new plants, crafting woodwork, or exploring sustainable practices, the forum is a space to celebrate successes, exchange ideas, and inspire others.
